# ü§ñ Description

SmartBot is a sophisticated AI-powered assistant that combines the capabilities of a traditional chatbot with voice interaction features. Built using machine learning and natural language processing, SmartBot can understand user queries, analyze sentiment, and provide intelligent responses through both text and voice interfaces. The bot is designed to be user-friendly and can perform various tasks including web searches, time queries, and general conversation.

- Internet connection (for speech recognition)

### Installation Steps

Clone the repository
```bash
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartbot.git
cd smartbot
```

### Install required dependencies
```bash
bashpip install speech-recognition
pip install pywin32
pip install tensorflow
pip install nltk
pip install textblob
pip install numpy


Download NLTK data
pythonimport nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```
### Prepare model files

Ensure chatbot_model.h5 is in the project directory

Ensure words.pkl and classes.pkl are available

Update the path to intents.json in the code


Run the application
```bash
bashpython SmartBot.py
```

üìã Required Files

Make sure these files are present in your project directory:

smartbot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SmartBot.py          # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intents.json         # Intent patterns and responses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatbot_model.h5     # Trained TensorFlow model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ words.pkl           # Vocabulary pickle file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classes.pkl         # Intent classes pickle file

# üîß How It Works
1. Mode Selection

Upon startup, SmartBot asks the user to choose between chatbot or voice assistant mode
Voice commands are processed to determine the preferred interaction method

2. Input Processing

Chatbot Mode: Accepts text input from the user
Voice Assistant Mode: Uses speech recognition to convert voice to text

3. Intent Recognition

User input is tokenized and lemmatized using NLTK
A bag-of-words model converts text to numerical representation
TensorFlow model predicts the intent with confidence scores
Only predictions above the error threshold (0.25) are considered

4. Response Generation

Based on the predicted intent, a random response is selected from the JSON file
Responses are contextually appropriate and varied

5. Sentiment Analysis

TextBlob analyzes the emotional tone of user input
Sentiment is classified as positive, negative, or neutral
Results are displayed alongside bot responses

6. Voice Output

In voice assistant mode, responses are spoken using Windows SAPI
Female voice is selected by default for better user experience

7. Special Commands

Google Search: "open google" triggers search functionality
Time Query: "what is the time" provides current time
Exit Commands: "stop" or "exit" terminates the session
