# ü§ñ Description

SmartBot is an advanced AI-powered assistant that combines the capabilities of a traditional chatbot, modern transformer-based conversational AI, and voice interaction features. Built using machine learning, Hugging Face transformers, and natural language processing, SmartBot can understand queries, analyze sentiment, and deliver intelligent responses via text or voice.

With Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integration, SmartBot can retrieve factual answers from a connected knowledge base when the default conversational model lacks information, making it both engaging and informative.

Microphone (for voice mode)

Internet connection (for speech recognition & RAG)

### Installation Steps

Clone the repository
```bash
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartbot.git
cd smartbot
```

### Install required dependencies
```bash
bashpip install speech-recognition
pip install pywin32
pip install tensorflow
pip install nltk
pip install textblob
pip install numpy


Download NLTK data
pythonimport nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartbot.git
cd smartbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Prepare model files

Ensure chatbot_model.h5 is in the project directory

Ensure words.pkl and classes.pkl are available

Update the path to intents.json in the code


Run the application
```bash
bashpython SmartBot.py
```

üìã Required Files

Make sure these files are present in your project directory:

Smartbot

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SmartBot.py         # Main application file

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RAG_chain.py        # Retrieval-Augmented Generation logic

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intents.json        # Intent patterns and responses

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatbot_model.h5    # Trained TensorFlow/Keras model

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ words.pkl           # Vocabulary pickle file

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classes.pkl         # Intent classes pickle file

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation

# üîß How It Works
1. Mode Selection

Upon startup, SmartBot asks the user to choose between chatbot or voice assistant mode
Voice commands are processed to determine the preferred interaction method

2. Input Processing

Chatbot Mode: Accepts text input from the user
Voice Assistant Mode: Uses speech recognition to convert voice to text

3. Intent Recognition

User input is tokenized and lemmatized using NLTK
A bag-of-words model converts text to numerical representation
TensorFlow model predicts the intent with confidence scores
Only predictions above the error threshold (0.25) are considered

4. Transformer Response

Generate conversational reply using DialoGPT.

5. RAG Fallback

 If reply is weak or generic, query external knowledge base.

7. Response Generation

Based on the predicted intent, a random response is selected from the JSON file
Responses are contextually appropriate and varied

7. Sentiment Analysis

TextBlob analyzes the emotional tone of user input
Sentiment is classified as positive, negative, or neutral
Results are displayed alongside bot responses

6. Voice Output

In voice assistant mode, responses are spoken using Windows SAPI
Female voice is selected by default for better user experience

7. Special Commands

Google Search: "open google" triggers search functionality
Time Query: "what is the time" provides current time
Exit Commands: "stop" or "exit" terminates the session
